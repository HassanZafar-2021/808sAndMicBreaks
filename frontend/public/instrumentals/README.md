3. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A

## How It Works
When you select an instrumental:
1. It plays in the background during recording
2. Your voice and the instrumental are both captured
3. The final recording includes both audio tracks
4. Auto-tune effects are applied to your voice only

## Creating Your Own Beats
Consider creating your own 808-inspired instrumentals using:
- Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) like FL Studio, Ableton, Logic Pro
- Free tools like GarageBand, Reaper, or online beat makers
- Focus on 808 drums, auto-tuned vocal samples, and atmospheric synths
- Reference the original album for inspiration while creating original content
